// config.typ
// Shared configuration for both the live slide deck (sample-presentation-slides.typ) and
// the continuous handout (sample-presentation-handout.typ).
//
// content.typ defines its content as a function that takes title-slide/
// pause/speaker-note/handout-note/two-column-slide/full-slide as
// parameters -- plain body content under a heading needs no wrapper at
// all; Touying automatically turns it into a slide when the theme's
// slide-fn is registered (see basic-theme.with(...) below), which keeps
// content.typ close to a plain Org-mode export. Each entry point below
// supplies its own implementations of the remaining parameters:
// sample-presentation-slides.typ passes the real Touying building blocks (real
// pagination, animations, speaker notes); sample-presentation-handout.typ passes plain,
// non-paginating stand-ins so the whole thing renders as one flowing
// document instead of a slide deck.
